### What is TypeScript, and how does it differ from JavaScript?

**Answer:**
TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to the language. It allows developers to define types for variables, function parameters, and return values, which helps catch errors during development. TypeScript code is then transpiled into standard JavaScript, making it compatible with any JavaScript runtime. Unlike JavaScript, TypeScript supports features like interfaces, enums, and a more robust set of tools for object-oriented programming. Overall, TypeScript enhances code maintainability and scalability by providing a structured and typed approach to writing JavaScript applications.
