import React from "react";

const Home = () => {
    return (
        <div>
            <h2> Home Page </h2>
            <p>
                Next, update the App functional component with the following
                route. Another feature of v6 library to notice here is that the
                element prop of a Route component now allows you to pass a React
                component rather than just the name of that React component.
                This makes it easy to pass props down the routes:
            </p>
        </div>
    );
};

export default Home;
